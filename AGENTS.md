## Project Overview
This is an Electron application project using pnpm as the package manager.

## Build/Test Commands
- **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
- **Test**: No test framework configured (package.json shows placeholder test command)
- **Start Electron app**: `npx electron .` or `pnpm exec electron .`

## Project Structure
- Root contains only `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- No source code files present yet (empty project)
- Uses Electron v37.2.0

## Code Style Guidelines
Since this is a new/empty project, establish these conventions:
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow standard JavaScript/Node.js naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)
- Use ES6+ features and async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Development Notes
- This appears to be a fresh Electron project setup
- No existing code style patterns to follow
- No linting or formatting tools configured yet
- Consider adding ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configuration
